Udacity Front End Web Development - Project 3: Online Resume
## Synopsis

This is the third project for Udacity's **Front End Web Development** course.  I was provided with starter code and needed to complete **resumeBuilder.js** by building out four JSON objects, each representing a different resume section.  The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information

## Files
